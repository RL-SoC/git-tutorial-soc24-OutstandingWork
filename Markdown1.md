# Hi Everyone
## My name is Pratyush Ranjan
I have just completed my 2nd Year at BTech. Chemical Engg. Dept. I am passionate about tackling real world problems with my sheer interest in Machine learning.
I am commited to learn a lot from this project. I liked about how the key concepts are being revised in 1<sup>st</sup> week. Also the Task 1 is good enough to revise concepts of OOPS in Python. The introductory videos also were targeted to teach us the essence of Reinforcement Learning and cover the essentials so that we can work in a group together (with the use of GitHubü§ù). Hoping to make great connects while working on this project!!
